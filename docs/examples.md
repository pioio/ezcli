# Usage Examples
(This page was autogenerated, do not edit manually)
Best way to learn is by example. Here are some examples of how to use `taskcli`.

You can also view them by running `taskcli --examples` on the terminal.
### basic
```python
# To define a task, simply add the @task decorator to a function,
# and then run `taskcli foo <args>` to run that function
# The first line of docstring is used as the description of the task when you run `taskcli`.
from taskcli import task

@task
def foo():
    """This lines ends up as the list output.

    This line is not shown in the list outpu
    """
    print(a + b)
```
### arguments
```python
#

@task
def task1(age: int, name: str = "alice"):
    """This task has two positional arguments, one of them optional."""
    pass

@task
def hello2(height: int=42, *, person: str = "john"):
    """This task has one positional, and one optional argument.
    Args after the "*" are named only.
    call with: taskcli hello2 25 --name person"""
    pass
    
```
### aliases
```python
# Aliases can be defined as strings, or iterable of strings

@task(aliases="t1")
def task1():
    pass

@task(aliases=("t2","foobar"))
def task2():
    pass
```
### Customize tasks base on custom conditions
  
You can batch customize the tasks programmatically,  
For example to add a default argument to all tasks.  
For example, you can append a custom tag to all tasks with a certain name pattern  
Example below adds the tag "prod" to all tasks with "prod" in their name, marks them as important, as makes  
them the listed in red.  
              
```python

from taskcli import Task, tt, task

@task
def deploy_to_prod():
    pass

tasks:list[Task] = tt.get_tasks()
for t in tasks:
    if "prod" in t.name:
        t.important = True
        t.tags += ["prod"]
        t.name_format = "{red}{name}{clear}"
```
